A mobile-oriented EDH deckbuilding companion

### What is "EDH"?
**EDH** (acronym for "**E**lder **D**ragon **H**ighlander") or **Commander** is a popular *Magic: The Gathering* format. A format describes the way in which someone may play *Magic: The Gathering*.
The Commander format consists of:
1. A legendary creature, designated as your Commander
2. 99 cards, all within your Commander's color identity
3. One, or more friends to play with

### What's the use for this app?
Up until now, most tools and websites for deckbuilding (e.g. Moxfield, Archidekt, Scryfall...) were NOT really adapted or oriented for mobile devices, making it pretty hard to build decks on the go.
This app is here to bring changes. **A mobile-first app Homonculus-assisted deckbuilder**!

### "Homonculus-assisted"? Huh?
You read that right. The app's mascot, and your personal assistant, is the one who gave his name to the app.
Meet Dkbldr!
